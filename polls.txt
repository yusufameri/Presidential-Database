Bush and John Kerry? George W. Bush says health care must be more affordable. We can lower costs by small businesses banding together to negotiate lower insurance rates, stop the frivolous lawsuits so doctors pay less for medical malpractice insurance and provide tax credits so working families can afford coverage. Bushs new Medicare plan means seniors will save on drugs. The plan provides a drug savings card for all seniors and twelve hundred dollars for lower income seniors to help pay for the drugs they need. Bush says John Kerrys proposal is the wrong prescription, as it gets the government too involved in our health care system which will only end up costing consumers more and limiting their choices. John Kerry says America faces a health care crisis, and President Bush doesnt get it. Health care costs are skyrocketing, over forty million people have no insurance, and new jobs lack good benefits. With big contributions from the insurance and drug companies, President Bush stopped the government from negotiating lower prices and stopped seniors from buying lower cost prescriptions in Canada. His Medicare bill is a giveaway to the drug companies and forces seniors to join HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations). Kerry proposes allowing the government to use its power to negotiate lower drugs prices, making it easier for employers to provide coverage for workers and making sure we cover all children.

Bush and John Kerry? George W. Bush says he believes marriage is the union of one man and one woman. We should continue to recognize heterosexual marriage as ensuring, promoting, and supporting a tested social structure for the bearing and raising of children. Bush says we must remember though the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches us that each individual has dignity and value in Gods sight. While Bush says different states should have the freedom to allow civil unions, because judges in states like Massachusetts insist on legalizing gay marriage, the courts have left no choice and Bush therefore supports an amendment to the Constitution that defends the sanctity of marriage. John Kerry says he is opposed to gay marriage. We should maintain marriage as a union of a man and a woman, but we do need a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages where the federal government dictates what people must do. Our states have always handled the question of marriage. Kerry says he personally hopes states bar gay marriage but allow civil unions, where partners can at least be allowed the same health care benefits, visitation rights and inheritance. Kerry says, it is sad that the president, apparently for political reasons, is promoting this amendment, instead of addressing the problem of jobs and health care.
